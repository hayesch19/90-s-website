      <h4>&#x25CA; Getting to see the world &#x25CA;	</h4>
      <p>Growing up my parents wanted us to have adventures and for them the best way was to take us out and see the world.
        <br>Thanks to that I had the chance to see some of most beautiful parks in the counrty. These were trips that to 
        <br> this day I remember and hope to one day revisit when I get a chance.</p>

      <h4>&#x25CA; Getting to unplug &#x25CA;	</h4>
      <p>In this day and age we have become extreamly connected. While that is amazing I know for me it can get to be to much.
        <br> One of my greatest joys is getting out to an amazing camp site and getting to put my phone in ariplane mode.
        <br> Granted I still keep it with me for photos or emergencies its still nice to get away from the world for a bit.</p>
        
      <h4>&#x25CA; Creates memories &#x25CA;</h4>
      <p>Even the little trips an hour down the road can create some of the best memories. One my most recent trips I went to
        <br> Ocala National Forest with a friend of mine and I will get to enjoy the memeories of us kayaking down the river
        <br> there for years to come. Not all camping trips have to be huge endevors.</p>

      <h2><u>My Favorite Camping Locations</u></h2>
      <br>
      <h3><u>Joshua Tree National Park</u></h3>
      <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm"><img class="park" src="./images/joshua_tree.jpg" alt="Joshua Tree National Park"></a>
        <p>Joshua Tree was one of the first national parks I ever went to and it was to place that I learned to rock climb.
          <br>For the several years I lived on the west coast this beautiful park became a highlight of my summers.
          <br>Even after moving to the east coast I have still made the trip to visit.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Ocala National Forest</u></h3>
        <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/ocala"><img class="park" src="./images/Ocala.jpg" alt="Ocala National Forest"></a>
        <p>Ocala National Forest has been a favorite spot of mine since moving to florida. There is a river that runs through
            <br>the area just a short walk from most of the camp sites that is a blast plus Juniper Springs is one of the best
            <br>places to go and cool off during those long Florida summer days.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Sequoia National Forest</u></h3>
        <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sequoia/"><img class="park" src="./images/Sequoia.jpg" alt="Sequoia National Forest"></a>
        <p>Sequoia National Forest should be on everyones to do list if you are making a list of parks to visit. I had the 
            <br>best time hiking around and just exploring all this park has to offer. While walking down the trails in the forest
            <br>you truley get to experiance the peace and beauty that can be found outdoors.</p>
